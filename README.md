This is my first project. I wrote it learning the basics of programming with the book "Opus magnum C ++ 11". Part of the code is taken from the book as an inspiration and reworked for my idea of creating a mini cmd application for vocabulary learning, e.g. English. The application allows you to save words in selected text files in specific folders. Once we write down the words we want to learn, we can choose the file with the words we would like to test. Then the words in the chosen language appear to us one by one and we enter its meaning. If the word matches, the program saves it and when we finish all the words from one file, the program shows us the number of correct answers in relation to the number of words.
